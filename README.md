# Data-Challenge-GDELT

The Global Database of Events, Language and Tone(GDELT) describes how social systems are operating and can show us a completely new perspective on the planet that we call home. This formed the motive behind selection of the world events database for the data challenge.

The march of history has always been more of a stumble than a steady rise. Did you really think the world has 'evolved' this way on purpose?

Economic growth and political stability are deeply interconnected. On one hand, the uncertainty associated with an unstable political environment may reduce investment and the speed of economic development. On the other hand, poor economic performance may lead to government collapse and political unrest. What would it look like to use massive computing power to see the world as seen through the eyes of the world's news media? We plan to use the world events database of GDELT repository, to highlight events of world leadership failure and provide an insight on how they impact the political stability of a nation, and in turn affect the world economy.

Also, social ties between nations do not change periodically and the human eye often fails to perceive world relations over a prolonged duration of time. We use this global database of society to analyze how the connections between nations change over time and present a spectrum of world relations to the audience.
